# CentOS7_PlexMediaServer_Install

I figured anyone could benefit from this script so releasing publicly.

A simple Bash script to install Plex Media Server on a secured CentOS 7 box.
I hold no responsibility, use at your own risk. This is a script you run after 
installing Minimal CentOS 7 to get Plex Media Server up and running.

Enjoy!
