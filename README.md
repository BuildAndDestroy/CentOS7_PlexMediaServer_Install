# CentOS7_PlexMediaServer_Install

I figured anyone could benefit from this script so releasing publicly.

A simple Bash script to install Plex Media Server on a secured CentOS 7 box.
I hold no responsibility, use at your own risk. This is a script you run after 
installing Minimal CentOS 7 to get Plex Media Server up and running.

The idea came from reading documentation here:

I found this did not work with IPTables and there are issues with creating directories.
So now all is scripted and requires minimal effort.


Enjoy!
